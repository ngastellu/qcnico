The purpose of this Python package is to gather all of my functions and scripts that I use to
process QCFFPI outputs in a single package that I can then import abd call from all of my other
projects.

This is to avoid having to store identical (or even worst: slightly different) versions of Python
files in the directories corresponding to all of my different projects and therefore make my life
*easier*.


** IDEA **
Could be worth making this a more general quantum chemistry package; functions like `AO_hamiltonian`
could be used on data produced by any other quantum chemistry package; not just QCFFPI.
Name the package `qcnico`
